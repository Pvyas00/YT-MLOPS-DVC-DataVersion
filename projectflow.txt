1. Create a git repo and clone it in local.
2. create code.py  and add code it. (it will save a csv file to  "data" folder)
3.Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc.
4. Now we do "dvc init" (create .dvcignore, .dvc )
5. now do "mkdi - S3" (create a new S3 directory) 
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    now it will ask to do: ("git rm --cached 'data' and  'git commit -m "stop tracking data"')
    becuase initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now remove it for Dvc to handle.
8. again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
